# XYZ Prototype

This is the repo for XYZ prototype, which contains the frontend Dart (Flutter) and backend JS/TS (Firebase) codes stored in folder named "user" and "backend" respectively. "xyz_ui" mainly contains codes for theming purposes only.

This was a project that I started with my roommate. It was an idea for "the next big thing app" startup. I focused on the programming (front & back end) and he focused on the UI/UX design. This is the [Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/GZ15WAnDXQUzR7Q14x8I1W/Wireframe-01?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=17%3A110&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.21&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=17%3A110) to Figma protype.

Neither of us were really going for "the next big thing", it was more to learn more about entrepreurship for my buddy and my interest in programming for me. For some context, I took a couple of courses that used Python for data analsysi stuff in my final year at University of Toronto (finance major) in the summer and realized that I really like programming. So I started to project to see if I really do like it or if it was just a summer fling.
